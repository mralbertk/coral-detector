# coral-reefs
Analyse coral growth images with deep learning. Student Project, [Data
ScienceTech Institute](https://datasciencetech.institute).

## About
The aim of this project is to support oceanographers at [CRIOBE](http://www.criobe.pf/eng/)
in their study of coral reefs in the pacific ocean. 
  
Researchers should be able to upload raw images of coral reefs to the application, which will apply 
automated image treatment steps before executing a segmentation model to detect corals present on 
the image and generating statistical data for further analysis.

#### Implemented Features
- Apply underwater image enhancements
- Automatic perspective correction & cropping of raw coral images
- Detection of corals
- Generation of statistics about coral coverage
